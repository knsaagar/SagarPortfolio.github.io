							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/App.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Background: One of the companies had launched an App for public. I was responsible to track the health of App metrics. I have redacted any identifyable information from the dashboard snapshot for privacy and security</p>
							<p>Explanation: I have meticulously crafted this interactive dashboard to offer a comprehensive overview of customer acquisition and engagement with the app. This user-friendly interface presents key metrics, showcasing the number of acquired customers over time, the conversion of users to paying subscribers, and a detailed breakdown of engagement metrics such as incidents, calls, chats, and more. Stakeholders can experience a seamless and insightful analysis of app's performance through this thoughtfully designed dashboard.</p>
